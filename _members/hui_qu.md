Qu Hui, female, is an Associate Professor, Master of Medicine, member of the Chinese Communist Party, and an Associate Chief Physician in the Department of Otorhinolaryngology of Dalian Medical University Second Affiliated Hospital, as well as a Master's Supervisor. She graduated from Dalian Medical University in 2012 with a seven-year bachelor's degree in Clinical Medicine. With over ten years of experience in clinical practice, teaching, and scientific research in otorhinolaryngology, she served as the Head of the ENT Department at Nagqu People's Hospital in Tibet from 2019 to 2020 as part of the Ninth Batch of Liaoning Province's Group Medical Aid Team to Tibet. Her clinical expertise includes the diagnosis and treatment of common ENT diseases, with a particular focus on pediatric snoring disorders and endoscopic nasal surgery. She holds several academic appointments, including serving as a Committee Member of the Dalian Medical Association's Otorhinolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery Branch (concurrently as Secretary), a Committee Member of the Rhinology Professional Committee of the China Health Promotion and Education Association, and a Committee Member of the Second Session of the Minimally Invasive ENT Surgery Professional Committee of the Liaoning Provincial Life Science Association.

In research, she adheres to a clinically oriented approach, using in-depth mechanistic studies to drive clinical translation, which has shaped her distinct research profile. Her current work centers on two key areas: first, investigating the nasal microenvironment and its role in disease pathogenesis; and second, exploring the biomechanics of adenoid and tonsillar hypertrophy in children and their impact on Obstructive Sleep Apnea-Hypopnea Syndrome (OSAHS), aiming to translate fundamental research into targeted clinical strategies.

She has participated in multiple National Natural Science Foundation of China projects, led two provincial-level research initiatives, and has published nine papers in Chinese core journals and SCI-indexed international journals.
