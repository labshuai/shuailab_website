Chen Zhuxue, a 2025-entry academic Master candidate in Ophthalmology at Dalian Medical University, is currently conducting research in the group led by Professor Wang Shuai. Her research focuses on the association mechanism between microglia-mediated inflammatory responses and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). By elucidating the core regulatory logic of immune-inflammatory pathways, her work aims to provide solid fundamental experimental evidence for the early intervention and precision treatment of fundus diseases.
