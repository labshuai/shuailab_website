# Shuai Wang Tri lab's Website

Academic Leader Dr. Wang Shuai, brings together key members including Jing Li, Jie Bai, Hui Qu, and Weikun Qu. The research focuses on systematically elucidating the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying disease pathogenesis and progression.

Our laboratory, located in Dalian, China, investigates the mechanisms underlying retinal vascular dysfunction and ocular surface disease, with a focus on inflammation, oxidative stress, and translational therapeutic strategies. We aim to understand how cellular stress responses and intercellular signaling drive tissue degeneration and barrier breakdown, and how these processes can be therapeutically targeted. We welcome academic and clinical collaborations.

## Highlights

**Retinal vascular disease and gene therapy**

We study the mechanisms by which inflammation and oxidative stress disrupt retinal and choroidal microvascular integrity in age-related and injury-induced retinal diseases. Using in vivo disease models and AAV-based gene therapy approaches, our work aims to identify protective pathways and secreted factors that stabilize the neurovascular unit and preserve retinal function

**Dry eye disease: mechanisms and biomaterial-based translational strategies**

We investigate the pathophysiology of dry eye disease, with an emphasis on ocular surface inflammation, epithelial stress responses, and tissue homeostasis. In parallel, we develop and translate biomaterial-based therapeutic platforms designed to improve ocular surface protection and long-term treatment efficacy.
